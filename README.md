### Specifically about Codenames
* Jeremy Neiman, [How to Create a Codenames Bot Part 1: Word2vec](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-codenames-bot-part-1-word2vec-62701de38e66)
* eyaler, [word2vec-slim](https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim)
* [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)
* [The Codenames AI Competition](https://sites.google.com/view/the-codenames-ai-competition) - couldn't find a report on what happened with this

* Not necessarily useful but came across this research paper which sounded interesting [Towards Reframing Codenames for Computational Modelling and Creativity Support using Associative Creativity Principles](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3325480.3325510)
